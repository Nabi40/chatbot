## chatbot 
 - Created a lightweight, asynchronous Telegram chatbot using python-telegram-bot and OpenAIâ€™s text-davinci-003 model to generate natural language responses.  

 - Designed message handling with async functions to efficiently process user commands and free-text input in real-time.  

 - Integrated environment-based configuration with dotenv and implemented structured logging for robust error tracking and maintainability.  

 - Packaged as a standalone bot script for direct CLI execution and minimal deployment overhead.
